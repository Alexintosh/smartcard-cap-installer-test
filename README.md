# smartcard-cap-installer-test

This is an android application that implements the basic APDU commands and secure channel to be able to install our [hardware wallet cap](https://github.com/status-im/hardware-wallet)
to a smartcard via NFC.

The Purpose of it is to be able to start testing smartcards and NFC connection with different cards and readers. 
This can help with UX/UI design while we implement the final solution in `status-react` and `status-go`.
